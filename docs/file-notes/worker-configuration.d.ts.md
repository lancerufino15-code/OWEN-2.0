# worker-configuration.d.ts

Purpose
- Generated TypeScript definitions for Cloudflare Worker runtime globals and bindings.

Key contents
- `Cloudflare.Env` and `Env` interfaces for Worker bindings used by editor tooling.
- Web platform types aligned to the configured compatibility date/flags.

Who reads/writes
- Generated by Wrangler (`wrangler types` / `npm run cf-typegen`).
- Read by TypeScript and IDE tooling for type checking and autocomplete.

Regeneration
- Re-run `npm run cf-typegen` (or `wrangler types`) after changing bindings in `wrangler.jsonc`/`wrangler.toml`.
